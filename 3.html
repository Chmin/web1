  <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript)</a> is a high-level, dynamic, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, prototype-based, weakly-typed, and interpreted language traditionally used for client-side scripting in web browsers. JavaScript can also be run outside of the browser with the use of a framework like Node.js, Nashorn, Wakanda, or Google Apps Script. Despite the name, it is unrelated to the Java programming language and shares only superficial similarities.

Unless a tag for a framework or library is also included, a pure JavaScript answer is expected for questions with the [tag: JavaScript] tag.

JavaScript runs on nearly every operating system, and an engine is included in mainstream web browsers. Developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications, it was originally called LiveScript but was renamed to JavaScript due to Netscape's friendly relationship with Sun Microsystems (creators of Java) at the time.
